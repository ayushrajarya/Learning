This is me learning python.
Learning from (https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python/)
The codes in here are written in python3.

Now, using chatGPT to create a roadmap and tutorials for learning.

I will only learn what ChatGPT shows and if there comes a topic which I should have learn earlier, then I will learn it then and there.
